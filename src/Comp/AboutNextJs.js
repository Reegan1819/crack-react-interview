        and other advanced features.
      </p>
      <h2>server-side rendering</h2>
      <p>
        Server-side rendering is a technique used to render web pages on the
        server before sending them to the client. This can improve performance
        and SEO, as the client receives a fully rendered page instead of an
        empty shell that needs to be filled in with JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering, making it
        easy to create dynamic web applications that render on the server. This
        can improve performance and SEO, as the client receives a fully rendered
        page that is ready to be displayed.
      </p>
      <h2>Static site generation</h2>
      <p>
        Static site generation is a technique used to generate static HTML files
        for web pages at build time. This can improve performance and SEO, as
        the client receives a fully rendered page that is ready to be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next.js provides built-in support for static site generation, making it
        easy to create static websites that are fast and SEO-friendly. This can
        improve performance and SEO, as the client receives a fully rendered
        page that is ready to be displayed.
      </p>
      <h2>File-based routing</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js uses a file-based routing system that makes it easy to create
        dynamic pages and APIs. This can improve developer productivity and make
        it easier to organize and maintain code.

      <h2>Automatic code splitting</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js provides automatic code splitting, which splits the JavaScript
        code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. This can improve
        performance and reduce the initial load time of the web application.

      <h2>Hot module replacement</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js provides hot module replacement, which allows developers to
        update the code in real time without refreshing the browser. This can
        improve developer productivity and make it easier to test and debug
        code.

      </p>
      <h2>API routes</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js provides API routes, which allow developers to create serverless
        APIs using the same codebase as the web application. This can improve
        developer productivity and make it easier to build and maintain APIs.

        which makes it easy to optimize web pages for search engines. This can
        improve the visibility and ranking of web pages in search engine
        results.
      </p>
      <h2>Fast refresh</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js provides fast refresh, which updates the code in real time
        without losing the state of the application. This can improve developer
        productivity and make it easier to test and debug code.
      </p>
      <h2>Customizable webpack configuration</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js provides a customizable webpack configuration, which allows
        developers to customize the build process and optimize the performance
        of the web application. This can improve performance and reduce the load
        time of web pages.
