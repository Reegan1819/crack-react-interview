      <h2>Redux</h2>
      <p>
        Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write
        JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and
        native environments and are easy to test.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Store</li>
        <li>Actions</li>
        <li>Reducers</li>
        <li>Dispatch</li>
        <li>Middleware</li>
        <li>Selectors</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Redux is a powerful tool for managing the state of your application. It
        provides a predictable and centralized way to manage data flow and state
        changes. By using Redux, you can write more maintainable and scalable
        applications that are easier to test and debug.
      </p>
      <h2>About Middleware</h2>
      <p>
        Middleware provides a way to interact with actions that have been
        dispatched to the store before they reach the reducer. It is commonly
        used for logging, crash reporting, routing, and other side effects.
      </p>
      <h2>Redux Thunk</h2>
      <p>
        Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators
        that return a function instead of an action object. This function can
        perform asynchronous operations and dispatch actions when they are
        complete.
      </p>
      <h2>Redux saga</h2>

      <p>
        Redux-Saga is a middleware library for managing side effects in Redux
        applications. It makes it easier to handle complex asynchronous flows,
        such as data fetching, through a concept called "sagas," which are
        implemented using generator functions. Here’s an in-depth look at
        Redux-Saga:
