      <h1>About UseMemo</h1>
      <p>
        useMemo is a React hook that memorizes the output of a function. It will
        only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has
        changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on
        every render.
      </p>
      <h2>Declaring Memoized Values</h2>
      <p>
        To declare a memoized value, you can use the useMemo Hook as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Call useMemo inside your functional component to declare a memoized
        value. useMemo takes a function and an array of dependencies as
        arguments and returns the memoized value.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits of useMemo</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance Optimization: </strong>
        Prevents recalculating expensive operations on every render, which can
        significantly improve performance for complex components.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoids Unnecessary Renders:</strong>
        Helps to avoid passing new references of objects or arrays to child
        components unless necessary, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
      </p>
      <h2>Caveats</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Overusing useMemo:</strong>
        While useMemo can be useful for performance optimization, overusing it
        can lead to unnecessary complexity and reduced code readability. Only
        use useMemo when you have identified a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Premature Optimization:</strong>
        Use useMemo only when you have identified performance issues. Overusing
        it can lead to more complex code without significant benefits
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Correct Dependencies:</strong>
        ensure the dependency array is correct. Missing dependencies can lead to
        stale values, while extra dependencies can cause unnecessary
        recalculations.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The useMemo hook is a powerful tool in React for optimizing performance
        by memoizing the results of expensive calculations. By using useMemo
        appropriately, you can ensure that your components render efficiently,
        only recalculating values when necessary, and thus improving the overall
        performance of your React application.
