      <h1>What is React?</h1>
      <p>
        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces developed by
        Facebook. It is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript
        library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs
        from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
      </p>

      <h2>Features of React</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Declarative Syntax:</strong>
          <br />
          React allows developers to describe what the UI should look like for a
          given state. When the state changes, React efficiently updates and
          renders the necessary components, making the code more predictable and
          easier to debug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Component-Based:</strong>
          <br />
          React is all about building reusable components. Components are the
          building blocks of a React application. A React application is made up
          of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small,
          reusable piece of HTML.
          <strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong>
          <br />
          React encourages the creation of reusable UI components. Each
          component manages its own state and can be composed to build complex
          UIs. This modular approach enhances maintainability and scalability
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Virtual DOM:</strong>
          <br />
          React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. The virtual DOM is a
          lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses the virtual DOM to
          determine what has changed in the actual DOM and updates only the
          changed parts. This approach makes React applications fast and
          efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JSX:</strong>
          <br />
          JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to
          write HTML elements in JavaScript code. JSX makes it easier to write
          and understand React components. It also allows React to show more
          useful error and warning messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One-Way Data Binding:</strong>
          <br />
          React follows a unidirectional data flow. Data flows in one direction
          from the parent component to child components. This one-way data
          binding makes the code more predictable and easier to understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong>
          <br />
          React uses a virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithms to update
          the actual DOM as minimally as possible. This approach results in
          better performance and a smoother user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Context API:</strong>
          <br />
          The Context API is a feature that allows developers to share data
          between components without having to pass props down through the
          component tree. This makes it easier to manage state and share data
          across different parts of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hooks:</strong>
          <br />
          Hooks are a new addition to React that allow developers to use state
          and other React features in functional components. Hooks provide a
          more concise and readable way to write components and manage state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>React Router:</strong>
          <br />
          React Router is a library that allows developers to add routing
          capabilities to React applications. With React Router, developers can
          create single-page applications with multiple views and navigation
          between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server-Side Rendering:</strong>
          <br />
          React can be used for server-side rendering, which improves the
          performance and SEO of web applications. Server-side rendering
          generates the initial HTML on the server and sends it to the client,
          reducing the time it takes for the page to load.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong>
          <br />
          React has a large and active community of developers who contribute
          to the ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources available for
          React. This vibrant community makes it easy to find solutions to
          common problems and stay up to date with the latest developments in
          React.
