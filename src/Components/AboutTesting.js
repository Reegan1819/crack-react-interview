      <h2>About test in react</h2>
        <p>
            Testing is an important part of software development. It helps to
            identify bugs and errors in the application. In React, there are
            different types of testing that can be done to ensure that the
            application works as expected. Some of the common types of testing in
            React are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit Testing</li>
            <li>Integration Testing</li>
            <li>End-to-End Testing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Unit testing is the process of testing individual units or components
            of the application in isolation. In React, unit testing is commonly
            done using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Unit
            tests are used to test the functionality of individual components and
            ensure that they work as expected.
        </p>
        <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Integration testing is the process of testing how different units or
            components of the application work together. In React, integration
            testing is done to test the interaction between different components
            and ensure that they work together as expected. Integration tests are
            used to test the integration of different components and ensure that
            they work together as expected.
        </p>
        <h2>End-to-End Testing</h2>
        <p>
            End-to-end testing is the process of testing the entire application
            from start to finish. In React, end-to-end testing is done to test the
            application as a whole and ensure that all the components work
            together as expected. End-to-end tests are used to test the
            functionality of the application from the user's perspective and
            ensure that it works as expected.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Testing is an important part of software development. In React, there
            are different types of testing that can be done to ensure that the
            application works as expected. Unit testing is used to test individual
            components, integration testing is used to test the interaction between
            different components, and end-to-end testing is used to test the
            application as a whole.
